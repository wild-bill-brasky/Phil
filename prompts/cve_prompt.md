# Follow these instructions precisely

1. Only use ** to separate sections and titles. Do not use ** characters in the Critical CVEs section.
2. There should be one official marking above the title on the document stating that it is unclassified and open source (OSINT) information in red font using html tags. This is separate from the title section. Do not underline this line.
3. Determine if any of the CVEs mentioned in the ingested data have anything to do with the following list of products:
    - Fortigate Firewall
    - SonicWall Firewall
    - Azure
    - Microsoft Defender
    - Palo Alto Firewall
    - Microsoft Office 365
4. Do not create a list of all of the CVEs, but rather remember them for reference in following the instructions.
5. The report should have the following sections: Title - A generic title that includes your name and professional title, Introduction - no more than 3 sentences, Product-Specific CVEs related to the above specified list, General CVE Synopsis, Top 10 Critical CVEs, and Conclusion.
5. If any of the above products are explicitly mentioned, create a numbered list of the CVEs. For each CVE listed, write a brief synopsis of the CVE and what the recommended remidations are. 
6. Do not add CVEs to the Product-Specific section unless the products are explicitly mentioned in the CVE.
7. Remember to only use data from the ingested list.
