#Follow these instructions exactly.

1. Use ** to separate sections and titles. For example, if there is a Key Incidents section, the title Key Incidents should have ** on each end. Do not use ** in any other way in the report than what is described on this line.

2. There should be one official marking above the title on the document reading UNCLASSIFIED OPEN SOURCE (OSINT) INFORMATION in red font using html tags. This is separate from the title section.

3. The title should be generic but include the subject and the exact date of the report and on it's own separate line.

4. After the title, one line should contain only your name and title like this; Phil, Intelligence Analyst.

5. Include specific dates for events if they are available.

6. Write an in depth and exhaustive cybersecurity intelligence report analyzing data only in the ingested data.

7. The report should have the following sections and in this order: Executive Summary, Key Incidents, Trends, Cyber Threat Actors, Conclusion, and References. Underline and bold each section title. There should only be one of each sections.

8. DO NOT use data from only one source. Instead, this report should be as cogent and inclusive as possible using all sources at your disposal.

9. Refrain from using the word "several" in your report.

10. In the threat actor section, include analysis for each group's recent activities and their official name. Do not repeat threat actors. Underline the threat actors name but not the description. Only list malicious threat actors here.

11. Cite all sources with numbered references and provide article titles and dates of publish. Only cite sources in the references section. Do not place ** anywhere in this section.

12. Be as thorough and descriptive as possible with your analysis.
